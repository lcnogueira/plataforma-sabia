# Contributing to `plataforma-sabia`

As the creators and maintainers of this project, we want to ensure that the project lives, continues to grow and evolves. The evolution of the project should never be blocked by any single person's time. One of the simplest ways of doing this is by encouraging a larger set of shallow contributors. Through this, we hope to mitigate the problems of a project that needs updates but there's no-one who has the power to do so.

### Quick Guide to Contributing

Here is a quick guide for doing code contributions to the project.

1. Find some issue you're interested in or a feature that you'd like to tackle. Make sure that no one else is already working on it. We don't want you to be disappointed.

2. Discuss the change you wish to make via issue with the maintainers before making a change.

2. Fork, then clone: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/plataforma-sabia.git`

3. Create a branch with a meaningful name for the issue: `git checkout -b fix-something`

4. Follow the [README](README.md#rocket-get-up-and-running) file instructions in order to install the dependencies and run the project locally.

5. Make your changes and commit: `git add` and `git commit`

    *Remember that we have a pre-commit hook that lints the code to prevent mistakes.*

6. Make sure the tests still pass: `npm run test` (in order to run the api tests) or `npm run jest` (for running the web package tests).

7. Push your branch: `git push -u origin your-branch-name`

8. Submit a pull request to the upstream repository.

9. Choose a descriptive title and describe your changes briefly.

10. Wait for a maintainer to review your PR, make changes if it's being recommended, and get it merged.

11. Celebrate! :tada:
