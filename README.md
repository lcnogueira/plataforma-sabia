## Motivation

The Sabia Platform has been developed in order to share technologies built to achieve the needs of the Brazilian semiarid region. The technologies can be registered for free by their creators (researchers from universities, research and innovation institutes, companies and individuals). A set of intermediation services between creators and consumers are available through the platform.

## :file_folder: How This Repository is Organized

This project codebase is organized into a 3 multi-package repository (a monorepo):

- [admin](packages/admin): it contains the project for the frontend of the platform's administrative system (built with [React Admin](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/) framework).
- [api](packages/api): includes the code for the backend (Rest API) of the platform's administrative system (built with [Adonis](https://adonisjs.com/) framework).
- [web](packages/web): contains the code for the platform's website (built with [NextJs](https://nextjs.org/) framework).

## :rocket: Get Up and Running
You can run this project on your local environment by following the steps below:

1. **Clone the project.**
    ```shell
      git clone git@github.com:ufersa/plataforma-sabia.git
    ```

2. **Install the dependencies.**:
    ```shell
      cd plataforma-sabia
      npm install
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies listed on each one of the application packages and link them in the repo together.**
    ```shell
      npm run bootstrap
    ```
4. **Follow the instructions included in each one of the package folders.**
    - [admin](packages/admin)
    - [api](packages/api)
    - [web](packages/web)

    P.S.: Alternatively, after setting the environment variables, start both the API and the website server by running `npm run start` from the root foolder.

5. **Open the source code and start editing!**

    The site is now running on `http://localhost:8000`. Use your code editor of choice and edit the files to see. Save your changes, and the browser will update in real time!

### Additional commands

You can find additional commands in the [package.json](package.json) file:
- `start:ci`: starts both the api and web server (useful if you want to run the e2e tests locally).
- `start`: starts both the api and web server in develop mode.
- `lint`: lints the code.
- `test`: runs both the api and web package tests.
- `coverage`: collects code coverage for the api and web package files.
- `test:e2e:run`: starts the environment and runs e2e tests (used on [travis config](.travis.yml)).
- `test:e2e`: runs the e2e tests. It's useful in case you want to run the tests locally (make sure both the api and web server are up).
- `build-coverage`: merges the collected coverage (used on [travis config](.travis.yml)).

## :test_tube: Running the Tests

### Unit Tests

You cand find information on how to run the unit tests in the README files inside each one of the packages of the project.

### E2E Tests

The project uses Cypress for running the e2e tests. The main purpose is testing the whole application, by simulating the user's behavior.

In order to run the cypress tests, you need to make sure both the API and web server are up (you can use the `start:ci` script to achieve this). Once they are both running, run `npm run test:e2e` and wait the cypress GUI pops up and the tests starts. You can also open the GUI and start the tests manually by running `npx cypress open`.

Alternatively, you can run `npm run test:e2e:run` to run both the api and web server and run the tests in headless mode. Be aware that this script is going to throw an error in case the API or web server are already running.

You also need to make sure [mailcatcher](https://mailcatcher.me/) is running, since the tests depend on it. Follow the steps below:

1. Install `mailcatcher` by running `gem install mailcatcher`.
2. Run `mailcatcher` to start the tool.
3. Visit `http://localhost:1080/` to see the web interface.

All of the emails should be sent to `smtp://localhost:1025`. Therefore, you need to set the `SMTP_HOST` and` SMTP_PORT` variables in the [API .env file] (packages / api / .env.example) so that the emails are catch by MailCatcher.
